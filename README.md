# Emma Elisabeth Knit

## Overview
EMMA is a knitwear design brand. This page is going to be itÂ´s homepage, where you can buy kniting patterns.
The goal is to get this project to a level where customers safely can buy a pattern (get pattern-file on e-mail).

## To do
- Page for the cart and checkout needs to be made. Both on same page.
- All back end development is missing.
- Add JavaScript for the Nav on smaller screens.
- Make the whole page responsive - from computer to small phones.
- Make the photos on the Instagram section automaticly update from the Instagram account.
- And more...

## Language
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- On the patten.html you can filter between different laguages. This is language for the patterns, and not the page.
- On a smaller screen the top menu changes. The menu is coded in html and css, but not finished with javascript.
- The images on the instagram section directs you to the actual instagram post.

### For building:
1. Never work directly on the main!
