# Emma-Elisabeth-Knit

EMMA Webpage

EMMA is a knitweardesign brand. This page is going to be its homepage, where you can buy knitingpatterns.

The goal is to get this project to a level where customers safely can buy a pattern (get pattern-file on e-mail).

There needs to be a page for cart and checkout. Both on same page.

On the patten.html you can filter between different laguages. This is language for the patterns, and not the page.

On a smaller screen the top menu changes. The menu is coded in html and css, but not finished with javascript.

For building:
Never work directly on the main!
